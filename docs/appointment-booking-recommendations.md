# Appointment Booking Flow Recommendations

## Overview
Based on the Alma-style "Find therapy" form approach, here are recommendations for implementing an appointment booking flow for Windsong Psychiatric.

## User Flow

### 1. Entry Points
- Hero section CTA button ("Schedule Appointment")
- Fixed "Help" button can trigger booking widget
- CTA section buttons
- Navbar "Book Now" link

### 2. Multi-Step Form Structure
Similar to Alma's approach, implement a multi-step form:

#### Step 1: Insurance/Payment
- Radio buttons: "Use insurance" vs "Pay out of pocket"
- If insurance: Insurance provider dropdown
- If self-pay: Show pricing information

#### Step 2: Location Preference
- In-person (Huntersville or Fort Mill)
- Virtual/Telehealth
- No preference

#### Step 3: Appointment Type
- Initial evaluation
- Follow-up appointment
- Medication management
- Therapy session

#### Step 4: Provider Selection
- Show Dr. Davis with:
  - Professional photo
  - Brief bio
  - Specialties
  - Availability indicator

#### Step 5: Schedule
- Calendar widget showing available dates
- Time slots for selected date
- Timezone confirmation for virtual appointments

#### Step 6: Patient Information
- Name, email, phone
- Date of birth
- Brief reason for visit (optional)
- Emergency contact

#### Step 7: Confirmation
- Appointment summary
- Instructions (what to bring, telehealth setup)
- Add to calendar options
- Confirmation email sent

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```jsx
// BookingFlow.jsx
const BookingFlow = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    paymentMethod: '',
    insurance: '',
    location: '',
    appointmentType: '',
    provider: '',
    date: '',
    time: '',
    patientInfo: {}
  });

  const steps = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Payment', component: PaymentStep },
    { id: 2, name: 'Location', component: LocationStep },
    { id: 3, name: 'Type', component: AppointmentTypeStep },
    { id: 4, name: 'Provider', component: ProviderStep },
    { id: 5, name: 'Schedule', component: ScheduleStep },
    { id: 6, name: 'Information', component: PatientInfoStep },
    { id: 7, name: 'Confirm', component: ConfirmationStep }
  ];

  // Progress indicator
  // Step navigation
  // Form validation
  // API integration
};
```

### State Management
- Use React Context or Redux for complex form state
- Persist form data in localStorage for abandonment recovery
- Track analytics events for drop-off analysis

### Performance Considerations
1. **Code Splitting**: Load booking flow as separate chunk
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic form works without JS
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Show selections immediately
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful fallbacks for booking errors

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation between steps
- Screen reader announcements for step changes
- Clear error messages
- High contrast mode support

## Integration Requirements

### Backend API Endpoints
- `/api/insurance-providers` - List accepted insurance
- `/api/availability` - Check provider availability
- `/api/appointments` - Create/update appointments
- `/api/patients` - Patient management

### Third-Party Services
1. **Calendar Integration**
   - Google Calendar API
   - Outlook Calendar API
   - Apple Calendar (.ics files)

2. **Payment Processing** (if accepting online payments)
   - Stripe for credit cards
   - HSA/FSA card support

3. **Telehealth Platform**
   - Doxy.me integration
   - Zoom for Healthcare
   - Custom WebRTC solution

4. **Insurance Verification**
   - Availity or similar service
   - Real-time eligibility checks

## Design Patterns

### Modal vs Page Navigation
- Modal overlay for desktop (like Alma)
- Full-page experience on mobile
- Smooth transitions between steps

### Visual Design
- Progress indicator at top
- Clear step numbering
- Back/Next buttons
- Skip optional steps
- Success animations

### Error Handling
- Inline validation
- Clear error messages
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback to phone booking

## Security Considerations
- HIPAA compliance for patient data
- SSL/TLS encryption
- PCI compliance if handling payments
- Regular security audits

## Analytics & Optimization
- Track conversion funnel
- A/B test different flows
- Monitor drop-off points
- Optimize for common paths

## Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly interface
- Simplified forms
- Native date/time pickers
- Reduced steps on mobile

## Future Enhancements
1. Recurring appointment scheduling
2. Family/group appointment booking
3. Waitlist functionality
4. SMS reminders and confirmations
5. Intake form integration
6. Insurance pre-authorization

## Implementation Timeline
1. Phase 1: Basic booking flow (2-3 weeks)
2. Phase 2: Insurance integration (1-2 weeks)
3. Phase 3: Calendar integrations (1 week)
4. Phase 4: Advanced features (ongoing)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for form components
- Integration tests for API calls
- E2E tests for complete flow
- Usability testing with real users
- Load testing for high traffic
